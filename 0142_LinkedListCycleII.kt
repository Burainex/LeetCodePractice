/*
 * 142. Linked List Cycle II
 * URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/description/
 *
 * Description:
 * Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
 * Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle.
 * Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
 * -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
 * pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: tail connects to node index 1
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
